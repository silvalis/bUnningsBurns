Metric U Caliburn Family Nerf Blasters, based on parts available from Bunnings and other Australian stores.


This is a metric modified version of Steven Lawver "Captain Slug"'s Nerf Caliburn U project available here https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:3981538
The whole purpose of this project is to eliminate hard to acquire hardware for the rest of the world, but most specifically, for Australia. The driving philosophy of this project is

"Hardware should be easily available from common retail shops"

The following hardware is required for this project
- Aluminium channel 16x12x1.6mm (Bunnings, Action Aluminium, Ullrich, etc)
- Aluminium flat bar 12x3mm ~2x300mm bars
- M3x6mm Standoffs (RS, Element14, Ebay)
- M3x8mm Button Head Screw (Any good hardware shop)
- M3x8mm Countersunk Screws
- M5x8mm Button Head Screw
- M5 Nuts
- 2mm Nails
- 8mm extension springs (Bunnings, model TBA)
- M5 or 3/16" threaded rod and appropriate nuts (if you want the front rail section)
- 1-1/2x1-3/8" Polycarbonate tube. This was not modified to 40x36mm for compatibility with commercially available plungers/rams (FLF, Worker, CS, etc). modified files for 40x36 coming later.
- 35x30x2.5mm Nitrile O-rings
- Silicone Grease

Nerf blaster specific hardware from BlasterTech (Or similar shop)
- 320, 350 or 400mm MM 16mm Barrel

- BT27 endcap coming soon
- Worker Caliburn Vanguard Ram ( Grind two parallel sides flat near the front of the pusher (approx 10mm), in line with the narrow section. to allow he mag lips to pass over the ram)
